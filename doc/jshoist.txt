INTRODUCTION                                    *jshoist*

Provides commands to hoist a 'var' declaration to the closest function scope
as per Javascript best practices.

COMMANDS                                        *jshoist-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

                                                *jshoist-:JsHoist*
:JsHoist                This command must be issued while the cursor is
                        positioned on a line where a declaration like
                        var <name> = <value>; is present. It causes the
                        assignment to stay where it is, and the var
                        declaration to be written right below the closest
                        function scope that includes the assignment.
